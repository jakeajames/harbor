# Harbor (iOS 11 like)

![Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eswick/harbor/master/readme_resources/icon.png "Harbor")

This is Harbor, modified to be an iOS 11 style dock for iPads

Compile with [theos](https://github.com/dhowett/theos). I've tried to make it as easy as possible. After installing theos *properly*, `make package install` should be all you need to run!

Precompiled copies will be available ~~for purchase in the BigBoss repo once purchases are enabled, for those who wish to contribute / don't want to compile. If you do this, thank you very much!~~ on this repo http://iapps4u.net/cydia
